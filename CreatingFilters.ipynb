    "After trying the speech recognition library, we realized that there was too much noise apart from the fundamental frequenncy emitted by the electrolarynx. For that reason, we decided to create butterworth bandpass filters. We tested it out on one video from each participant to see how it compared to the originial mp4 files. The filtering frequencies were determined soley by listening to each recording.The reason a butterworth bandpass filter is used is because it provides a maximal flat frequency in the passband unlike other regular passband filter.This stack exchange post was used to implement the filters:\n",
